# Introduction
This repo contains the instruction list for creating the data set for the Coursera specialisation Data Science/Getting and Cleaning Data in R. It is based on the Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
It also contains the code book for the created data set.

# Prerequisties
To run the instruction list in run_analysis.R the following must be true:
- The original data set must be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
- It must be unzipped in the working directory of R.
- The packages plyr and dplyr must be installed.
